# Drawing

Drawing is desktop program for **Windows 10** where you can draw different shapes with given colour.

### Controls
```
Ctrl+S --> Save file (file is saved on server as well, if it is running and connected to client)
Esc --> Close the program
```
If you press on any shape you will have to enter it's size in the console.

*This program is not made to be useful neither for anyone, nor for me. I wrote it just to have at least minor experience in writing projects using **golang***

## Important
To be able to launch that program you have to download [sdl-2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/).
