# Drawing

Drawing is desktop program for **Windows 10** where you can draw different shapes with given colour.

### Controls
```
Ctrl+S --> Save a picture in your "Downloads" folder, you will have to write filename in the console
(file is automatically saved on server as well, if it is running and connected to client)
Esc --> Close the program
```
If you press on any shape you will have to enter it's size in the console.

*This program is not made to be useful neither for anyone, nor for me. I wrote it just to have some experience in writing dekstop applications using **golang***

## Important
To be able to launch that program you have to download [sdl-2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/).
